### Description

This example decimates a mesh. The SetTargetReduction function
specifies how many triangles should reduced by specifying the
percentage ([of triangles to be removed. For example, if the mesh
contains 100 triangles and SetTargetReduction(.90) is called, after
the decimation there will be approximately 10 triangles - a 90%
reduction.
