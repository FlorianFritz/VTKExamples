### Description
This example creates two spheres and combines them together into one polydata. The vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter is used to find the two spheres as they are separate regions (disconnected). If region 0 is selected, the small sphere is extracted. If region 1 is selected, the large sphere is extracted.<br />
