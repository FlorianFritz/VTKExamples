### Description
Sometimes it is helpful to view the results of a segmentation without any post processing. This example converts the point data from a labeled volume into cell data. The surfaces are displayed as polydata. If you want to created smoothed polydata models from your segmented volumes, see the example [models from labeled volume data (Discrete MarchingCubes)]]. The input volume must be in [[ MetaIO/Documentation| META format]]([VTK/Examples/Medical/Cxx/GenerateModelsFromLabels|Create).
