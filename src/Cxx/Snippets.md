### Description
Snippets are chuncks of code that can be cut (*snipped*) and pasted into examples. We want each example tobe stand-alone, so we do not keep the snippet code in a library.

### Available snippets

#### SaveSceneToFieldData
Stores the current vtkCamera location in a vtkDataSet's vtkFieldData.
