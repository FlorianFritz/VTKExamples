### Description
This example creates three images of a square. Each square slightly overlaps the previous square. These three layers are then interpreted as the R, G, and B channel of an RGB image, by the use of {{class|vtkImageAppendComponents}}.

Note that you MUST add 3 inputs or no output will be produced.

For the reverse operation, see []([../ExtractComponents]).
