\firstletter{W}e return again to visualization algorithms.
This chapter describes algorithms that are either more complex to implement, or less widely used for 3D visualization applications.
We retain the classification of algorithms as either scalar, vector, tensor, or modelling algorithms.

\section{Scalar Algorithms}

As we have seen, scalar algorithms often involve mapping scalar values through a lookup table, or creating contour lines or surfaces.
In this section, we examine another contouring algorithm, dividing cubes , which generates contour surfaces using dense point clouds.
We also describe carpet plots.
Carpet plots are not true 3D visualization techniques, but are widely used to visualize many types of scalar data.
Finally, clipping is another important algorithm related to contouring, where cells are cut into pieces as a function of scalar value.
