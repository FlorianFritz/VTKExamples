\firstletter{W}e have seen how to represent basic types of visualization data such as image data, structured grids, unstructured grids, and polygonal data.
This chapter explores methods to transform this data to and from these various representations, eventually generating graphics primitives that we can render.
These methods are called algorithms, and are of special interest to those working in the field of visualization.
Algorithms are the verbs that allow us to express our data in visual form.
By combining these verbs appropriately, we can reduce complex data into simple, readily comprehensible sentences that are the power of data visualization.

\section{Introduction}

The algorithms that transform data are the heart of data visualization.
To describe the various transformations available, we need to categorize algorithms according to the structure and type of transformation.
By structure we mean the effects that transformation has on the topology and geometry of the dataset.
By type we mean the type of dataset that the algorithm operates on.

Structural transformations can be classified in four ways, depending on how they affect the geometry, topology, and attributes of a dataset.
