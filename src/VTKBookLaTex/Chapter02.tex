\chapter{Object-Oriented Design}
\label{chap:ood}

\firstletter{O}bject-oriented systems are becoming widespread in
the computer industry for good reason. \\Object-oriented systems are more modular, easier to maintain, and easier to describe than traditional procedural systems. Since the Visualization Toolkit has been designed and implemented using object-oriented design, we devote this chapter to summarizing the concepts and practice of object-oriented design and implementation.

\section{Introduction}
Today’s software systems try to solve complex, real-world problems. A rigorous software design and implementation methodology can ease the burden of this complexity. Without such a methodology, software developers can find it difficult to meet a system’s specifications. Furthermore, as specifications change and grow, a software system that does not have a solid, underlying architecture and design will have difficulty adapting to these expanding requirements.
