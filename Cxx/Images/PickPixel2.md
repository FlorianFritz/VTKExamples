### Description
This example demonstrates how to continuously retrieve pixel values using the mouse.

This example is a slight modification of the existing example [Picking a
pixel](Cxx/Images/PickingAPixel). The main
difference is the display of the exact pixel coordinates and values
instead of interpolated values.
