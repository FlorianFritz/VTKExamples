### Description
This example displays a 3D polygonal text saying "Hello", using the 9x15 font from [Window System|X Windows]]. That is a raster (pixelized) font, so characters are formed by converting the pixels on each character into quadrilaterals. {{class|vtkVectorText}} generates higher quality polygonal representations of text, so it is recommended instead -- see [[../VectorText]]([wikipedia:X) for an example of this.
