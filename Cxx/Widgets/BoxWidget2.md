### Description
This example uses a {{class|vtkBoxWidget2}} to manipulate an actor. The widget only contains the interaction logic; the actual box is drawn by the accompanying {{class|vtkBoxRepresentation}}.
Contrary to the older {{class|vtkBoxWidget|older implementation}}, this widget doesn't provide functionality to assign it to one or more actors, so that has to be implemented manually. The box is dimensioned and positioned by passing a bounding box to <code>PlaceWidget</code> method, with the <code>SetPlaceFactor</code> method providing a scaling factor in relation to that bounding box. The transformations applied to the box can be used to manipulate any number of object(s), via a custom callback class, which is passed to the box widget through the <code>AddObserver</code> method.

The older implementation {{class|vtkBoxWidget}} provides functionality to receive a {{class|vtkProp3D}} for the initial positioning and sizing, but the transformation synchronization still needs to be done manually. See []([../BoxWidget|BoxWidget]) for a simple example of how to use it.
